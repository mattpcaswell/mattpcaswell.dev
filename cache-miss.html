    <h1 class="hero-header">I think I figured it out</h1>
    <p>
        Life is far more complicated, nuanced, and deep than I give it credit for.
        
        I keep doing my shitty human pattern matching on myself, others, situations, plans, futures for myself and almost every
        single one of my perceptions.
        
        This is useful for some things. Sorting through internet content for example.
        
        This is bad for some things. Trying to figure out what to do with my life. There is just far too much variance in any
        single category to have the fuzzy average of my brain hold any real meaning for what a possible life-decision might
        actually have in store for me.
        
        So should I just blindly accept everything that comes my way? Should I just be a yes man?
        
        Maybe.
        
        I think at the very least I should stop trying to predict every moment and start experiencing and enjoying the nuance of
        now. Both in just a carnal enjoyment of the present moment but also in my decision making. Should I go pee? Yes. I have
        to pee. But I like this current mental space and I’m scared that leaving it means I’m just going to something far worse.
        Stop assuming that about the future you know nothing about.
